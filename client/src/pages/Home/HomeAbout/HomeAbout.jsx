        <p>The project is aimed to develop a novel Smart Irrigation System (SIS) to address water scarcity challenges in agriculture, by leveraging the strengths of Internet of Things (IoT), Machine Learning (ML), and web development</p>
        <p>This three-stage approach combines the power of real-time data collection, predictive analytics, and user-friendly visualization for a comprehensive Smart Irrigation System. By integrating these technologies, we aim to empower farmers with data-driven insights for optimizing water usage, maximizing crop health, and promoting sustainable agricultural practices </p>
